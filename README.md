# Capstone Project Assignment: ML Model Development and Optimization

## Overview
The capstone project is a comprehensive assessment designed to integrate and apply the
knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout the course. This project involves selecting a
real-world dataset, conducting thorough analyses, building machine learning models, and
addressing ethical considerations related to data usage. By completing this project, you will
develop practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and critical thinking, preparing you for
professional challenges in the field of data science.

## Project Objectives
- **Application of Skills:** Utilize machine learning techniques learned in class to analyze a
dataset of your choice.
- **Problem Solving:** Develop a structured approach to identify, analyze, and solve a real-
world problem using data-driven methods.
- **Critical Thinking:** Evaluate various machine learning models and determine the most
appropriate for your dataset.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Understand and analyze the ethical implications of your work,
including issues of bias, fairness, and data privacy.

## Milestones and Detailed Steps
### Milestone 1: Data Preparation Report

**Purpose:** To prepare your dataset for analysis by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA),
data cleaning, and feature engineering.

Steps:<br>
**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**<br>
- Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
- Analyze data distributions for numerical features (e.g., using histograms, box
plots).
- Visualize relationships between variables (e.g., scatter plots, correlation
matrices).
- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.

**2. Data Cleaning**
- Identify and handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
- Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, categorical encoding).
- Remove or address outliers identified in the EDA.
- Document all steps taken during the cleaning process, explaining your reasoning.

**3. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features that could enhance the predictive power of your models
(e.g., combining features, extracting date components).
- Transform categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot
encoding.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
- Provide a clear explanation of the rationale behind each feature created or
modified.

**4. Report Preparation**
- Compile all findings, methods, and visualizations into a comprehensive Jupyter
Notebook.
- Ensure the notebook is well-structured, with clear markdown sections explaining
each part of your analysis.

### Milestone 2: Model Development Report

**Purpose:** To apply machine learning algorithms to your dataset, evaluate model performance,
and document the modeling process.

Steps:<br>
**1. Model Selection**
- Research and select appropriate machine learning models based on your data
and problem type (e.g., regression, classification).
- Justify your model choices by referencing their strengths and weaknesses in
relation to your dataset.

**2. Model Training**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
- Train your selected models on the training set, documenting the processes used
(e.g., hyperparameters, training algorithms).
- Use techniques such as cross-validation to optimize model parameters.

**3. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision,
recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE, R² for regression).
- Compare the performance of different models and justify your findings.
- Visualize results using appropriate plots (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).

**4. Code Quality Review**
- Ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and well-commented for clarity.
- Follow best practices in coding standards.

**5. Report Preparation**
- Document your model selection process, training methods, evaluation metrics,
and results in a well-structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Include visualizations and interpretations of your model's performance in
markdown cells.

### Milestone 3: Final Project Report

**Purpose:** To analyze the performance of your final model, outline a comprehensive deployment
plan, and discuss expanded ethical considerations.

Steps:
**1. Final Model Performance Analysis**
- Analyze the performance of the final model chosen from Milestone 2.
- Include a comparative analysis with alternative models, discussing performance
metrics and insights from model interpretation techniques (e.g., SHAP values,
LIME).
- Discuss any limitations of your model and potential areas for improvement.

**2. Deployment Plan**
- Outline a detailed deployment architecture that includes the model, data
pipelines, monitoring systems, and user interfaces.
- Simulate a mock deployment and provide a video demonstration or detailed
description of the process.
- Discuss considerations such as scalability, maintenance, and compliance with
legal regulations.

**3. Ethical Considerations**
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the ethical implications of your project, focusing
on a broader range of issues such as societal impacts and stakeholder effects.
- Provide recommendations for ensuring fairness, accountability, and compliance
with regulations.

**4. Report Preparation**
- Compile all analyses, plans, and discussions into a comprehensive Jupyter
Notebook.
- Ensure the notebook is well-structured, clear, and professionally presented.

## Conclusion
This capstone project will provide you with hands-on experience in machine learning while
fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical considerations in your work.
